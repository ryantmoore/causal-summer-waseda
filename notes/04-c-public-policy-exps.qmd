## Goals

\Large

>- Inspire your thinking about what _could_ be an experiment (our best hope for causal inference)
>- Introduce you to some results from experiments in the field
>- Draw out lessons for applied and community-based research

## Seguro Popular

\large

- _Partner_: Mexican federal government and health bureaucracy
- _Intervention_: Randomize federal health infrastructure spending, household insurance to Mexican households
- _Finding_: Reduced catastrophic health expenditures for households
- _A Lesson_: Applied work can inspire new methodological research

## Nurse Triage Line

\large

- _Partner_: DC Fire and Emergency Management Services
- _Intervention_: Randomize whether 911 emergency callers talk to a nurse
- _Finding_: Reduced ambulance dispatches, transports; increased primary care visits
- _A Lesson_: Advocates matter. Even when it seems impossible, there may be a way. Effects can be huge.

## Welfare Recertification, TANF

\large

- _Partner_: DC Human Services
- _Intervention_: Randomized whether households due to recertify received a behaviorally-informed reminder letter
- _Finding_: Improved recertification rates, especially when we indicate flexibility
- _A Lesson_: We can build _capacity_ in partners

## Retirement Savings of Public Employees

\large

- _Partner_: DC Human Resources
- _Intervention_: Randomized email with simplified decisions and present-framing future gains
- _Finding_: Improved contributions for those _already_ contributing, but 0 new contributors
- _A Lesson_: Human behavior is sticky!

## Policy Body-worn Cameras

\large

- _Partner_: DC Metro Police Department
- _Intervention_: Randomized whether police officers wore body-cameras
- _Finding_: No detectable effects on police use of force, citizen complaints, police activity
- _A Lesson_: Null effects can happen for many reasons, are important to share, and do not doom a program

## DC Flex: Flexible, shallow subsidy

\large

- _Partner_: DC Housing and Homelessness agencies
- _Intervention_: Flexible, shallow rent subsidy 
- _Finding_: Null effects on homelessness, but decreased use of other services (first year)
- _A Lesson_: Giving needy control can simplify administration without adverse outcomes

[@avimammoo23]

## Police Training at Nat'l Museum of African-American History and Culture

\large

- _Partner_: MPD, Nat Museum of African-American History and Culture
- _Intervention_: Randomized training of police officers on history of race and policing
- _Finding_: (Stay tuned!)
- _A Lesson_: Experiments can be imperfect, and approximate observational studies


## Warning Taxpayers about Preparers

\large

- _Partner_: US Tax Service (IRS)
- _Intervention_: Letters to taxpayers with info about their tax preparers
- _Finding_: Changed taxpayer filing behavior
- _A Lesson_: Well-designed experiments can measure interference/spillovers

## Opioid Buyback

\large

- _Partner_: Veterans Affairs Hospital
- _Intervention_: Reminder card mailed one week after surgery
- _Finding_: Improved rates of return by 30% (7pp)
- _A Lesson_: Connect at a reasonable, appropriate moment

## Fire Inspector Risk-Score Lists

\large

- _Partner_: DC Fire Inspectors
- _Intervention_: Randomize whether inspectors receive lists of buildings that come from *high risk scores* or *all risk scores*
- _Finding_: (Stay tuned!)
- _A Lesson_: We can combine data science predictive modeling and field experiments fruitfully; models should be validated in the field.

# Lessons

## Lessons

\Large

>- Relationships
>    - Collaboration
>    - Informing decisions
>    - Understanding implementers' goals
>- Registration
>    - Avoid $p$-hacking, fishing, HARKing
>    - Catch data you still need
>    - Toward "Standard Operating Procedures" (see [here](https://rtm-dc.github.io/LAB-SOP-experiments/))
>- Ride Along
>    - Understand how implementers view data
>    - Gain technical knowledge of context, processes  
(EMS, pothole team, fire inspectors, \ldots)
>    - Fastest way to learn: watch the experts

## Lessons

\Large

>- Applications reveal new statistical problems
>    - Design evaluations robust to _politics_
>    - Block on many predictors
>    - Clustered designs
>    - Sequential blocking
>    - Rerandomization for interference
>    - Asymmetric eligibility
>- Help build capacity
>- What data to ask for?
>    - The raw data
>    - The outcome, last time
>- Attend to ethics
>    - Avoid harm, gain consent
>    - We are constantly "experimenting"
>    - Resources are limited
>    - Agents really do want to learn
