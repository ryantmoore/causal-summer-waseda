## The Course: Learning Objectives

\large

>- Identify causal effects using the potential outcomes framework
>- Perform design-based inference for randomized experiments
>- Create and analyze variety of randomized designs, including for blocked, clustered,
conjoint, list, and multiarm bandit experiments

\pause 

>- Materials at  
https://github.com/ryantmoore/causal-summer-waseda
>- (Walk through syllabus)

## The Course: Conduct

\Large

>- Class discussion may be difficult!
>- I will ask you to quickly turn to someone nearby and _discuss_ questions
>- For example, soon, I will ask you whether a quantity has a valid _causal_ interpretation
>- For example, in a day or two, I will ask you how to leave a casino with a lot of \yen!
>- Often $\approx$ 1-2 minutes
>- We learn what we don't quite understand when we process/talk about it


# What is Causal Inference?

## What is Causal Inference?

\Large

\begin{center}
``What caused the terror attacks of 9/11?''
\end{center}

\begin{center}
vs.
\end{center}

\begin{center}
``What is the effect of foreign policy $X$ on domestic terror attacks?''
\end{center}

\pause

\begin{center}
``Causes of an effect''
\end{center}

\begin{center}

\begin{center}
``Effects of a cause''
\end{center}

## What is Causal Inference?

\Large

We will focus on "effects of a cause"\pause, where the "cause" is well-defined.

## Example: Canvassing and Program Enrollment

\pause 

\Large

"Canvassing": a systematic program where agents talk with residents (knock on doors) at the residents' home.

## Example: Canvassing and Program Enrollment

\large

Suppose we ask, ``Would a canvassing policy increase enrollment in a health insurance program?\text{''} \pause 

\vspace{2mm}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
Citizen & Canvassed? & Enrolled? \\ \hline
1 & Yes & Yes \\
2 & Yes & Yes \\
3 & No & No \\
4 & No & No
\end{tabular}
\end{center} \pause 

\vspace{2mm}

>- What fraction enroll under canvassing vs. no canvassing?  
>- $\frac{2}{2} - \frac{0}{2} = 1$
>- (For each person canvassed, expect 1 more enrollment.)

>- Did the policy "work" (cause more enrollment)?

## Motivating Example: Canvassing and Enrollment

\LARGE

But, is it causal? \newline \pause 
\vspace{1mm}

What do we really want to know? \newline   \pause 
\vspace{1mm}

Would canvassing actually _change_ anyone's enrollment? \newline \pause 
\vspace{1mm}

What would have happened under _other_ conditions? 




## Example: Canvassing and Enrollment

\large 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
 & & Would Enroll if & Would Enroll if  & \\
Citizen & Canvass? & Canvass? & No Canvass? & Enroll \\ \hline
1 & Yes & \only<2->{Yes} & \only<6->{\alert{(Yes)}} &  Yes \\
2 & Yes & \only<3->{Yes} & \only<6->{\alert{(No)}} &  Yes \\
3 & No & \only<6->{\alert{(Yes)}} & \only<4->{No} &  No \\
4 & No &\only<6->{\alert{(No)}} & \only<5->{No} &  No
\end{tabular}

## Example: Canvassing and Enrollment

Empirical data consistent with *different* _unobserved_ outcomes:

\vspace{4mm}

\large
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
 & & Would Enroll if & Would Enroll if  & \\
Citizen & Canvass? & Canvass? & No Canvass? & Enroll \\ \hline
1 & Yes & Yes & \alert{(Yes)} &  Yes \\
2 & Yes & Yes & \alert{(No)} &  Yes \\
3 & No & \alert{(Yes)} & No &  No \\
4 & No & \alert{(Yes)} & No &  No
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

What is the true causal effect of canvass? \newline  
What fraction enroll under canvass vs. no canvass? \newline  \pause 
$\frac{4}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$


## Example: Canvassing and Enrollment

\LARGE

\begin{center}
Well \ldots~ how do we know which?
\end{center}

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{center}
We can never know.
\end{center}

***

\LARGE

\begin{center}
Can we know for one person?
\end{center}

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{center}
We can never know.
\end{center}

***

\LARGE

\begin{center}
But I have some ideas.
\end{center}

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{center}
We could not canvass, then canvass later.
\end{center}

\pause  

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{center}
We can never know.
\end{center}


***

\LARGE

\begin{center}
We can never observe both ``Canvassed'' and ``Not Canvassed'' for a unit.
\end{center}

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{center}
We can never observe both \\ \it{potential outcomes}.
\end{center}

\pause  

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{center}
We can never observe both the \\ factual and the counterfactual.
\end{center}

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{center}
We can never know.
\end{center}

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

\LARGE

\begin{center}
We can never observe more than one {\it potential outcome} for a given unit.
\end{center}


***

\LARGE

\begin{center}
So, how can we get a {\it causal} estimate?
\end{center}

\pause 

\vspace{6mm}

\begin{center}
We infer missing potential outcomes.
\end{center}

## Why didn't we recover truth?

\large

The problem with our naive estimate of effect:

>- "Canvass" group $\neq$ ``No Canvass\text{''} group
>- The _potential outcomes_ help predict whether Canvass!

\pause 

\large
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
 & & Would Enroll if & Would Enroll if  & \\
Citizen & Canvass? & Canvass? & No Canvass? & Enroll \\ \hline
1 & Yes & Yes & \alert{(Yes)} &  Yes \\
2 & Yes & Yes & \alert{(No)} &  Yes \\
3 & No & \alert{(Yes)} & No &  No \\
4 & No &\alert{(No)} & No &  No
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\pause 

\vspace{2mm}

Knowing whether would "enroll under canvass" _predicts_ whether canvassed!

\pause 
$Pr(\text{Canvass} = \text{Yes} | \text{Would if Canvassed} = \text{Yes}) = \frac{2}{3}$  

\pause 
But 
$Pr(\text{Canvass} = \text{Yes} | \text{Would if Canvassed} = \text{No}) = 0$



## When comparing two groups **does** recover truth

\large

Here, potential outcomes do **not** help predict Canvass:

\large
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
 & & Would Enroll if & Would Enroll if  & \\
Citizen & Canvass? & Canvass? & No Canvass? & Enroll \\ \hline
1 & Yes & Yes & \alert{(Yes)} &  Yes \\
2 & Yes & Yes & \alert{(No)} &  Yes \\
3 & No & \alert{(Yes)} & Yes &  Yes \\
4 & No &\alert{(Yes)} & No &  No
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\pause 

Knowing whether enroll if canvass not predictive.

\pause 

>- What is the _true_ causal effect of canvass?  
>- $\frac{4}{4} - \frac{2}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$
>- What would we _observe_ as the effect of canvass?
>- $\frac{2}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$

\pause 

Good! \smiley



## When does comparing groups recover truth?


<!-- Formally, $Y_1, Y_0 \indep T$, or $E(Y_1, Y_0) = E(Y_1, Y_0 | T)$) -->

\Large

Neither _potential outcome_ should help predict treatment/intervention.  \newline  \pause 

\vspace{4mm}

True underlying responses in "Canvass" group $=$ 
True underlying responses in "No Canvass" group

***

\Large 

(Note: _observed_ outcomes can predict treatment.)  \newline \pause

That's the goal of an intervention!  \pause 

- Aspirin $\implies$ headache!  
- Canvass $\implies$ turnout!  
- Insurance $\implies$ health spending! 
- CBT $\implies$ remission! 

\pause 

But, full schedule of true underlying responses should **not** predict treatment.



## When does comparing groups recover truth?

\LARGE

How to ensure potential outcomes won't predict treatment?\newline  \pause 

\vspace{4mm}

How to _assign_ treatment so it won't predict potential outcomes?


## When does comparing groups recover truth?

\large

Possible _assignment mechanisms_:  

\pause 

\begin{itemize}
\item Let Citizens decide whether to get Canvass \pause 
\item[] (But, those who choose Canvass will Enroll anyway) \pause 
\item[] (We will estimate {\it too large} effect) \pause 
\item Let Party decide whom gets Canvass \pause 
\item[] (But, Party will only Canvass those it will affect) \pause
\item[] (We will estimate {\it too large} effect) \pause 
\item What if you {\it randomly} select whom gets Canvass? \pause 
\item[] (``Citizen was Canvassed'' won't help guess pot. out.) \pause 
\item[] (We will estimate {\it correct} effect)
\end{itemize}

# The Potential Outcomes Model


## What is Causal Inference?

\large

>- ``Effects of causes\text{''}

\pause 
\vspace{5mm}

> The objective is to determine for some population of units \ldots the 'typical' causal effect of the [treatment vs. control conditions] on a dependent variable $Y$.
\hspace{80mm} ---Rubin (1974)

\pause 

>- A "causal effect" is a comparative statement

## What is Causal Inference?

\Large

>- Central definition for causal inference:  
\quad ``a _well-defined_ treatment\text{''}
>- Units must be ``potentially exposable\text{''} to treatment
>- ``No causation without manipulation\text{''}
>- Timing of treatment: outcomes vs. covariates
>- Exclusivity of treatment (to unit)
>- Excludability (assignment effect only via Tr)
>- One study, one causal effect \pause (roughly)



## The Potential Outcomes Model: Ideas

\Large

>- _Unit_: a particular case at a point in time
>- _Treatment_: (putatively) causal variable of interest
>- _Potential outcome_: outcome that would obtain if unit were to receive tr condition
>- _Assignment mechanism_: means by which units come to be sorted into conditions

## The Potential Outcomes Model: Ideas

\Large

Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)

>- No versions of the treatment, varying in effectiveness
>- No interference between units


## The Potential Outcomes Model: Notation

\Large

>- Units: index $i \in \{1, \ldots, 2n\}$
>- Binary treatment: $T_i \in \{0, 1\}$


>- Pot outcome for $i$ under $T_i = 1$: $Y_{i1}$ or $Y_i(1)$
>- Pot outcome for $i$ under $T_i = 0$: $Y_{i0}$ or $Y_i(0)$

>- For vector of $Y_{i1} \quad \forall i$, write $Y_1$


## The Potential Outcomes Model: Notation

\large 

Observed outcomes

>- The observed outcome: $$Y_i = Y_i(1)\cdot T_i + Y_i(0)\cdot (1 - T_i)$$ \pause  
(sometimes written $Y_i^{obs}$) \pause 
>- If $T_i = 1$, $$Y_i = Y_i(1) \cdot 1 + Y_i(0)(1 - 1) = Y_i(1)$$
>- If $T_i = 0$, $$Y_i = Y_i(1) \cdot 0 + Y_i(0)(1 - 0) = Y_i(0)$$

\pause 

\vspace{-3mm}

The assignment mechanism _selects_ which potential outcome we observe.

## The Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

Statistical language 

>* _parameter_: unknown numeric value characterizing feature of
  prob model (Greek; $\theta$, $\beta$) 
>* _statistic_: quantity calculable from observed data.  A function. (Roman)
>* _estimator_: statistic used to approximate/guess parameter ($\hat{\theta}$, $\hat{\beta}$)
>* _estimand_: the parameter an estimator attempts to estimate 
>* _estimate_: application of an estimator func to some obs data

\pause 
``The sample statistic $\bar{x}$ is an estimator of true mean
param $\mu$".  

\pause 

$\mu$ is my estimand.  5.1 is my estimate.

## The Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

\large

For $i$, individual treatment effect

$$\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$$

<!-- ## Random variables and the Expectation -->

<!-- \large -->

<!-- _Random variable_ $X$ is a function mapping sample space to set of reals: $$X:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$$  -->

<!-- Random variables  -->

<!-- >- summarize outcome of probabilistic/stochastic trial -->
<!-- >- take numerical values.   -->

<!-- \pause  -->

<!-- E.g.,  -->

<!-- >- Let $X =$ number of heads in 3 coin flips.  Is $X$ a random variable? -->
<!-- >- Let $Y$ be outcome of two coin flips, $Y \in \{HH, TH, HT, TT\}$.  Is $Y$ a random variable? -->


<!-- ## Expectation of a Random Variable -->

<!-- The _expected value_ or _expectation_ of a random variable is mean of its outcomes, weighted by their probabilities.  For a discrete random variable, $$E(X) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_ip(x_i)$$ For continuous random variable, $$E(X) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} xp(x) dx$$ -->

<!-- Expectation is **not** the sample mean from particular instantiation, a particular data set.  We use sample mean $\bar{x}$ to _estimate_ the expected value. -->

<!-- ## Variance of a Random Variable -->

<!-- The _variance_ of a random variable is mean of outcomes' squared deviations from expectation, weighted by their probabilities: -->

<!-- \begin{eqnarray*} -->
<!-- V(X) & = & E[(X - E(X))^2]\\	 -->
<!-- & = & E(X^2) - (E(X))^2	 -->
<!-- \end{eqnarray*} -->


<!-- ## Properties of Expectation -->

<!-- * $E(c) = c$  -->
<!-- * $E(a+bX) = a+bE(X)$   -->
<!-- * $E(X+Y) = EX + EY$ -->
<!-- * If $X$ and $Y$ indep., then $E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)$ -->

<!-- ## Properties of Variance -->

<!-- * $Var(X) = E(X-EX)^2$  -->
<!-- * $Var(X) = E(X^2)-(EX)^2$  -->
<!-- * $Var(c) = 0$ -->
<!-- * $Var(Y|X) = E(Y^2|X)-(E(Y|X))^2$  -->
<!-- * If $X$ and $Y$ indep., then $Var(X+Y) = Var(X)+Var(Y)$  -->
<!-- * If $X$ and $Y$ indep, then $Var(X-Y) = Var(X)+Var(Y)$  -->




## The Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

>- Average treatment effect
	\begin{displaymath}
	ATE = \overline{Y_1 - Y_0} = \overline{Y_1} - \overline{Y_0}	
	\end{displaymath}

>- Average treatment effect for the treated
	\begin{displaymath}
	ATT = (\overline{Y_1} | T = 1) - (\overline{Y_0} | T = 1)
	\end{displaymath} 


## The Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

The average treatment effect (ATE):

\begin{eqnarray*}
\overline{\tau} = \overline{TE} = ATE &\equiv & \overline{Y_1 - Y_0} \\
& = & \frac{1}{2n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{2n} \left( Y_{i1} -
  Y_{i0} \right) \\ \pause
& = & \frac{1}{2n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{2n} \left( Y_{i1} \right) - \frac{1}{2n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{2n} \left( Y_{i0} \right) \\ \pause  
& = & \overline{Y_1} - \overline{Y_0} 	%\\ \pause
%& = & \frac{E(Y_1 | T_i =1 ) + E(Y_1 | T_i =0 )}{2} - \frac{E(Y_0 | T_i = 1) + E(Y_0 | T_i = 0)}{2}
\end{eqnarray*} 

\pause 

>- True?
>- Estimated?
>- Observable?


## The Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

\Large

Statistical Independence \pause 

Define 

$$ Y \independent X$$ 
as

$$Pr(Y | X) = Pr(Y)$$  

\pause 

(Knowing $X$ doesn't change probability of $Y$)


## The Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

Something we **can** calculate:

If we know $(Y_1, Y_0)$ indep of $T$ \pause \newline
(i.e., knowing true underlying response does **not** indicate $T$) \pause 

Then,

\pause 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\overline{Y_1} & = & (\overline{Y_1} | T = 1) \\ 
\overline{Y_0} & = & (\overline{Y_0} | T = 0)	
\end{eqnarray*}

\pause 

Then, can substitute 

\begin{eqnarray*}
	ATE & = & \overline{Y_1} - \overline{Y_0} \\
	& = & (\overline{Y_1} | T = 1) - (\overline{Y_0} | T = 0)
\end{eqnarray*}

\pause 

Observed diff in Tr and Co group means gives $\overline{TE}$!

## Why Experiments?

\large

Random assignment of treatment promotes 

$$(Y_1, Y_0) \independent T$$ \pause 

When $(Y_1, Y_0)$ and $T$ independent, we can substitute things we know

$$(\overline{Y_1} | T = 1) \text{ and } (\overline{Y_0} | T = 0)$$ \pause 

for things we can _never_ know

$$\overline{Y_1} \text{ and } \overline{Y_0}$$







## Common Assumptions, Null Hyp's in Causal Inference

\large

\begin{itemize}
\item Constant effect:

$$\tau_i = Y_{i1}-Y_{i0} = \tau \quad \forall i$$
\pause 

\item Null hypothesis of no average effect:

$$ATE = \overline{\tau} = 0$$
\pause 

\item Sharp null hypothesis of no effect: 

$$\tau_i = 0$$
\end{itemize}


## Compliance with Treatment Assignment

\note{Rubin's {\bf principal strata}}

\large

Sometimes, units don't follow assignment!

\pause 
\vspace{3mm}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
Assigned Tr & Assigned Co & Type \\ \hline
Tr & Co 	&  Complier \\  \pause 
Tr & Tr & Always-taker \\ \pause 
Co & Co & Never-taker \\ \pause 
Co & Tr & Defier 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



## Compliance with Treatment Assignment

\large

Of course, we cannot observe $i$ assigned both Tr and Co.

\pause 
\vspace{3mm}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
& & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Treatment Taken} \\
& & Treatment & Control \\ \cline{3-4}
Tr Assigned & Tr & Complier/Always & Never/Defier \\
& Co & Always/Defier & Complier/Never \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


## Common Estimates under Noncompliance

Let $T_i$ be treatment _assigned_, $D_i$ be treatment _received_.

\pause 

>- Intent-to-treat effect (as-assigned)
	\begin{eqnarray*}
	ITT &=& (\overline{Y_1} | T = 1) - (\overline{Y_0} | T = 0) \\
	&=& (\overline{Y_1} | T = 1, D(T=1)) - (\overline{Y_0} | T = 0, D(T=0)) 
	\end{eqnarray*} 
>- As-treated effect
	\begin{eqnarray*}
	ASTRE &=& (\overline{Y_1} | D = 1) - (\overline{Y_0} | D = 0)
	\end{eqnarray*}

## Unbiasedness

\Large

$$E(\hat{\theta}) = \theta$$

\pause 
\vspace{5mm}

>- $E\left[ \widehat{\overline{Y_1 - Y_0}} \right] = \overline{Y_1 - Y_0}$
>- $E\left[ \widehat{\beta_1} \right] = \beta_1$

<!-- E.g., Avg est of ATE $=$ true ATE -->

## Unbiasedness

\Large

What estimator used to estimate $\overline{Y_1 - Y_0}$?

\pause 
\vspace{5mm}

The difference-in-means estimator.

\pause 
\vspace{5mm}

$$\widehat{\overline{Y_1 - Y_0}} = \left(Y_1 | T_i = 1 \right) - 
\left(Y_0 | T_i = 0 \right)$$

\pause 
Is it a "good" estimator?

<!-- Strictly, these should be t_i = 1, e.g. (see GG) -->

## Unbiasedness

\Large

The difference-in-means estimator is _unbiased_ for the true average treatment effect. 

\vspace{8mm}

\pause 
(See `01-unbiased.R`)


## Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

- Individual TE
\begin{displaymath}
\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)
\end{displaymath}

- Average treatment effect
	\begin{displaymath}
	ATE = E(Y_1 - Y_0) = E(Y_1) - E(Y_0)

- Average treatment effect for the treated
	\begin{displaymath}
	ATT = E(Y_1 | T = 1) - E(Y_0 | T = 1)

## Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

The average treatment effect (ATE):

\begin{eqnarray*}
E(Y_{1} - Y_{0}) & =&  \frac{1}{2n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{2n} \left( Y_{i1} -
  Y_{i0} \right) \\
  & = & \frac{1}{2n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{2n} \left( Y_{i1} \right) -
  \frac{1}{2n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{2n} \left(Y_{i0} \right)\\
& = & E(Y_{1}) - E(Y_{0}) 	%\\
%& = & \frac{E(Y_1 | T_i =1 ) + E(Y_1 | T_i =0 )}{2} - \\
%&& \quad \frac{E(Y_0 | T_i = 1) + E(Y_0 | T_i = 0)}{2}
\end{eqnarray*} 



## Potential Outcomes Model: Estimands

- If we know $(Y_1, Y_0)$ indep of $T$ 
<!-- (as random assignment of Tr promotes),  \pause -->

- Then,

\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left(Y_{1} \right) &=& E(Y_{1} | T = 1)\\ E\left(Y_{0} \right) & = & E(Y_{0} | T = 0)	
\end{eqnarray*}

- Then, can substitute 

\begin{eqnarray*}
	ATE & = & E(Y_{1}) - E(Y_{0}) \\
	& = & E(Y_1 | T = 1) - E(Y_0 | T = 0)
\end{eqnarray*}

\pause 

Observed diff in Tr and Co group means gives ATE!

\end{eqnarray*}

\pause 

$$\underbrace{E(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | T_i = 1)}_{\text{ATT}} + \underbrace{E(Y_i(0) | T_i = 1) - E(Y_i(0) | T_i = 0)}_{\text{Selection Bias}} $$

## Random Assignment Mechanisms

>- Simple/complete randomization  
$\quad$ (Bernoulli trial, prob $\pi$)
>- Complete randomization / random allocation  
$\quad$ (fixed proportion to tr)
>- Blocked randomizations  
$\quad$ (fixed proportion to tr, w/in group)
>- Cluster randomizations  
$\quad$ (assignment at higher level)


## The Potential Outcomes Model: Assignment

\large

Observed outcome: $Y_i = Y_i(1)\cdot T_i + Y_i(0)\cdot (1 - T_i)$ 

\vspace{7mm}

The assignment mechanism _selects_ which potential outcome we observe.

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

\normalsize

(@gergre12 use $Y_i = Y_i(1)\cdot d_i + Y_i(0)\cdot (1 - d_i)$ to highlight that we observe pot outcome from treatment actually taken, not hypothetical or assigned treatment.)

## Ignorability

Assignment mechanism is _ignorable_ if $Y_{mis}$ conditnly indep of $T$

$$P(T | X, Y_{obs}, Y_{mis}) = P(T | X, Y_{obs})$$

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

Nothing in unobserved $Y_{mis}$ informs relationship between $Y_{obs}$, $T$.

## Unconfoundedness

Some ignorable mechanisms are _unconfounded_, too.

$$P(T | X, Y_{obs}, Y_{mis}) = P(T| X)$$

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

Nothing in $Y$ informs $T$.

\pause 

\vspace{5mm}

These are special cases of conditional independence.

## An Assignment Mechanism

Little & Rubin (2000):

| Patient | Y   | T   |
| :-----: | :-: | :-: |
| 1       | 6   | 1   |
| 2       | 12  | 1   |
| 3       | 9   | 0   |
| 4       | 11  | 0   |

\pause 

Clearly, treatment is harmful.  $\overline{Y(1)} - \overline{Y(0)} = 9 - 10 = -1$.

Clearly, treatment is harmful.  $$\overline{Y(1) | T = 1} - \overline{Y(0) | T = 0} = 9 - 10 = -1$$
